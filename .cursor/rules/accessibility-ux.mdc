# Accessibility & UX Best Practices

## WCAG Compliance

The project must follow Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA standards:

1. **Perceivable**:
   - Provide text alternatives for non-text content
   - Ensure sufficient color contrast (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text)
   - Make content adaptable to different viewing contexts
   - Make it easy to distinguish foreground from background

2. **Operable**:
   - Ensure keyboard accessibility for all functionality
   - Provide enough time for users to read and interact
   - Avoid content that could cause seizures or physical discomfort
   - Provide clear navigation and help users find content

3. **Understandable**:
   - Make text readable and understandable
   - Make content appear and operate in predictable ways
   - Help users avoid and correct mistakes

4. **Robust**:
   - Maximize compatibility with current and future tools

## Neurodiversity Considerations

Beyond standard accessibility guidelines, the project must account for neurodivergent users:

1. **Disability Types to Consider**:
   - **Permanent disabilities**: Blindness, physical disabilities, neurodivergence
   - **Temporary disabilities**: Broken arm, feeling unwell, faulty device
   - **Situational disabilities**: Busy/loud environments, poor bandwidth, holding a baby

2. **Focus and Attention**:
   - Minimize distractions and decorative elements that don't serve functional purposes
   - Design interfaces as utilities to support focused tasks rather than as decoration
   - Consider that users may need to maintain focus for extended periods
   - Avoid visual elements that dominate screen real-estate unnecessarily

3. **Typography and Reading**:
   - Select appropriate typography that supports neurodivergent readers
   - Avoid assuming specific font shapes alone will address dyslexic readers' needs
   - Consider reading patterns and text layout for different neurotypes
   - Maintain consistent text formatting and structure

4. **Sensory Considerations**:
   - Carefully evaluate animations and motion for potential sensory triggers
   - Provide users control over audio elements and autoplay
   - Ensure closed captions meet high standards of accuracy and timing
   - Consider sensory sensitivities in color choices and contrast levels

## UX Design Principles

1. **Simplicity & Clarity**:
   - Minimize cognitive load with clear interfaces
   - Use consistent UI patterns and behaviors
   - Provide clear feedback for all actions
   - Guide users through complex workflows

2. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensure usability across different screen sizes
   - Test on multiple devices and browsers
   - Implement mobile-friendly touch targets (at least 44x44px)
   - Use appropriate input methods for different contexts

3. **Performance & Reliability**:
   - Optimize load times and responsiveness
   - Implement graceful degradation for edge cases
   - Provide appropriate loading indicators
   - Save user progress and prevent data loss

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Semantic HTML**:
   - Use proper semantic elements (headings, lists, etc.)
   - Implement ARIA attributes where necessary
   - Ensure proper focus management
   - Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation

2. **Error Prevention & Recovery**:
   - Validate inputs in real-time
   - Provide clear error messages
   - Offer suggestions for correction
   - Allow users to review before final submission

3. **Visual Design**:
   - Ensure sufficient text size (minimum 16px)
   - Use proper heading hierarchy
   - Maintain consistent visual language
   - Use color as enhancement, not the sole indicator
   - Consider neurodivergent color perception and processing

## Component-Specific Guidelines

Drawing from neurodiversity design principles, pay special attention to:

1. **Numbers**: Present numerical information in accessible formats for dyscalculia
2. **Typography**: Select fonts considering readability for dyslexic users
3. **Color**: Avoid color combinations that may trigger sensory sensitivities
4. **Buttons, Links and Inputs**: Design for clarity and predictability
5. **Interface (UI)**: Minimize visual noise and prioritize function over decoration
6. **Animations**: Provide controls to reduce or eliminate motion
7. **Contrast**: Balance sufficient contrast while avoiding harsh transitions
8. **Communications**: Write clear, concise content with simple language
