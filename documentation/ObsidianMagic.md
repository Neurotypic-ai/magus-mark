# OBSIDIAN MAGIC: AI-POWERED CONVERSATION TAGGING SYSTEM

This document provides detailed specifications for a conversation tagging system designed to organize ChatGPT
conversations in Obsidian. The system includes tag structures, model prompts, implementation details, and architecture
for both a command-line tool and an Obsidian plugin.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

Obsidian Magic is a tool for organizing exports of ChatGPT conversations and other AI chat history in Obsidian (a
markdown-based knowledge management application). The core functionality is an AI-powered tagging system that analyzes
conversations and applies a consistent set of tags to make them easier to search, navigate, and understand.

The project arose from the need to organize large collections of AI chat exports that become difficult to search and
reference over time. While previous attempts at automated tagging resulted in too many inconsistent tags that diminished
their usefulness, this system implements a carefully designed taxonomy with fixed categories to ensure tag consistency
and utility.

The system consists of:

1. A TypeScript command-line tool for batch processing
2. An Obsidian plugin for seamless integration
3. Shared core functionality and configurations

Both components use the OpenAI API to analyze and tag conversations with standardized metadata, following a carefully
designed tag philosophy.

## 1. TAGGING MODEL & TAG PHILOSOPHY

### Hierarchical Tagging System

The system implements a sophisticated AI-powered tagging framework with the following structure:

- **Year**: Strictly 4-digit years (e.g., `2023`, `2024`), automatically extracted from conversation metadata or
  content.

  - The system will use date entity recognition to identify the most relevant temporal context.
  - If multiple years are mentioned, the AI will select the dominant year based on frequency and context.

- **Life Area**: A curated taxonomy of life domains, including:

  - `career`
  - `relationships`
  - `health`
  - `learning`
  - `projects`
  - `personal-growth`
  - `finance`
  - `hobby`

  The AI will identify the primary life area through contextual analysis, even when not explicitly mentioned.

- **Topical Tags**: A three-tier hierarchical classification system:

  - **Primary Domain**: Selected from a maintained taxonomy of knowledge domains
    - Example domains: `software-development`, `philosophy`, `design`, `psychology`, etc.
  - **Subdomain**: More specific categorization within the primary domain
    - Example: If domain is `software-development`, subdomains include `frontend`, `backend`, `devops`
  - **Contextual Tag**: A flexible "wildcard" tag that can be either:
    1. Another domain/subdomain if the conversation crosses domains
    2. A special tag from a curated "wildcard list" of cross-domain concepts
    3. A newly proposed tag if none of the existing tags adequately capture an important dimension

- **Conversation Type**: Precisely one conversational modality from:
  - `theory` - Abstract or conceptual discussions
  - `practical` - Implementation-focused or action-oriented
  - `meta` - Self-referential or about the process itself
  - `casual` - Informal, exploratory conversations
  - `adhd-thought` - Non-linear, associative thinking patterns
  - `deep-dive` - Comprehensive exploration of a topic
  - `exploration` - Initial investigation of new concepts
  - `experimental` - Testing ideas or hypotheses
  - `reflection` - Contemplative assessment
  - `planning` - Forward-looking organization
  - `question` - Inquiry-driven exchange
  - `analysis` - Detailed examination of specifics

This taxonomy is extensible by design, with clear governance for adding new categories:

- Domain/subdomain pairs can be extended through a review process
- Wildcard tags grow organically based on system usage
- Core categories (year and conversation type) remain relatively fixed

### Classification Strategy

The system employs a sophisticated multi-stage classification approach:

1. **Domain/Subdomain Classification**:

   - The AI will strictly adhere to the official taxonomy for primary domains and subdomains.
   - Uses embedding similarity and semantic matching to map conversation topics to the most relevant domain/subdomain
     pairs.
   - When no clear match exists, the system will map to the closest parent category rather than creating new categories.
   - Confidence scores are calculated for each tag assignment.

2. **Controlled Vocabulary Expansion**:

   - Only the third "contextual" tag allows for organic growth with new suggestions.
   - When suggesting a new contextual tag, the AI provides a confidence score and rationale.
   - New tags are logged for periodic review and potential inclusion in the official taxonomy.
   - A feedback loop between tag usage patterns and taxonomy updates ensures the system evolves with user needs.

3. **Multi-label Classification Approach**:
   - Each conversation is guaranteed to have a year tag and conversation type tag.
   - Life area tags are applied when the confidence score exceeds a configurable threshold.
   - Topical tags follow a strict precedence rule: domain → subdomain → contextual.
   - Tag assignments use a weighted voting system combining embedding similarity, keyword frequency, and contextual
     relevance.

This creates a balance between classification consistency and the ability to capture novel concepts as they emerge.

### Tag Management & Inference

The system implements a context-aware tag management strategy:

1. **Dynamic Tag Allocation**:

   - Each conversation is analyzed for topical relevance using advanced NLP techniques.
   - The system applies between 0-3 topical tags, depending on content relevance.
   - Multi-topic conversations receive hierarchically structured tags (domain → subdomain → contextual).
   - Tag application follows the principle of "quality over quantity" - no tags are better than incorrect tags.

2. **Handling Tag Sparsity**:

   - Year and conversation type are mandatory and will always be inferred, even if not explicit.
   - Life area tags are applied only when the content clearly relates to a specific life domain.
   - If a conversation lacks clear topical focus, the system will apply fewer tags rather than forcing potentially
     irrelevant categorization.
   - Confidence thresholds determine when tags should be applied vs. omitted.

3. **Tag Consistency Management**:
   - By default, the system overwrites existing tags to maintain consistency across conversations.
   - Configurable behavior allows for:
     - **Overwrite mode**: Replace all existing tags (default)
     - **Merge mode**: Keep existing tags that don't conflict with new classifications
     - **Augment mode**: Only add tags for empty categories
   - The system maintains a version history of tag changes for audit and rollback purposes.

This approach ensures precise, contextually appropriate tagging while accommodating varying levels of topic specificity.

## 2. MODEL PROMPT ENGINEERING

### Context-Optimized Prompting

The system employs OpenAI's recommended prompt engineering practices to maximize classification accuracy while
minimizing token usage:

1. **Intelligent Context Selection**:

   - Rather than passing entire conversations, the system uses an embedding-based extractive approach to identify the
     most relevant segments.
   - For long conversations, a two-stage process is used:
     1. First pass: Generate an embedding-based summary focusing on topical indicators
     2. Second pass: Submit the summary plus key excerpts for detailed tagging
   - Conversations under a configurable token threshold are processed in their entirety.

2. **Structured Prompt Design**:

   - Clear task delineation with explicit instructions and formatting expectations
   - System message establishes the role: "You are a precise conversation classifier specialized in identifying topics,
     conversation types, and contextual metadata."
   - Clearly delimited sections using markdown separators to distinguish instructions, reference data, and content
   - Example:

     ```
     <conversation>
     [Extracted conversation content]
     </conversation>

     <instructions>
     Analyze the conversation above and classify it according to the taxonomies below.
     </instructions>
     ```

3. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**:

   - Instructs the model to "think step-by-step" before final tag assignment
   - Utilizes OpenAI's recommended approach of breaking complex tasks into subtasks:
     1. First identify the general topic and temporal context
     2. Then map to specific domains and subdomains
     3. Finally determine conversation type and life area
   - Confidence scoring for each tag to enable threshold-based filtering

4. **Reference Knowledge**:
   - Includes the complete taxonomy inline for exact matching
   - Provides clear examples of correct classification for different conversation types
   - Uses "few-shot" learning with 2-3 examples to guide the model's understanding

This approach optimizes for both token efficiency and classification accuracy, following OpenAI's best practices for
prompt design.

### Precision-Oriented Prompting Style

The system uses a precisely engineered prompting style optimized for classification accuracy:

1. **Directive Clarity**:

   - Formal, specific instructions with explicit constraints
   - Clear step-by-step guidance on the classification process
   - Unambiguous criteria for tag selection
   - Example:
     ```
     You must classify this conversation using ONLY the approved tags listed below.
     For domain/subdomain pairs, select exactly from the provided taxonomy.
     For the contextual tag, either select from the approved list or, ONLY if none apply,
     suggest a single new tag with justification.
     ```

2. **Structured Response Format**:

   - Explicit JSON output template with required fields
   - Example response format provided inline
   - Clear instruction to follow the exact output structure:
     ```
     Provide your classification as a valid JSON object with the following structure:
     {
       "year": "YYYY",
       "life_area": "area_name",
       "topical_tags": [
         {"domain": "domain_name", "subdomain": "subdomain_name"},
         {"contextual": "contextual_tag"}
       ],
       "conversation_type": "type_name",
       "confidence": {
         "overall": 0.95,
         "life_area": 0.87,
         "domain": 0.92,
         "conversation_type": 0.94
       }
     }
     ```

3. **Error Prevention Mechanisms**:
   - Explicit instructions to prevent hallucination of non-existent tags
   - Clear guidance on handling uncertainty ("If you're unsure about a tag, set confidence below 0.7")
   - Specific instructions for handling edge cases

This approach follows OpenAI's recommendation to "write clear instructions" and "use delimiters to clearly indicate
distinct parts," ensuring maximum classification accuracy and consistency.

### Quality Assurance Framework

The system implements a sophisticated quality assurance approach with multiple review options:

1. **Confidence-Based Workflow**:

   - Each tag assignment includes a confidence score from 0.0 to 1.0
   - Tags with confidence above configurable thresholds (default: 0.85) are auto-applied
   - Tags with confidence in a "review zone" (default: 0.65-0.85) are flagged for optional human review
   - Tags with confidence below the minimum threshold (default: 0.65) are rejected or replaced with broader categories

2. **Selective Explanation Generation**:

   - For high-confidence tags (>0.85), no explanation is provided to minimize token usage
   - For medium-confidence tags (0.65-0.85), a brief rationale is generated
   - For new contextual tag suggestions, a detailed justification is always provided
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
       "tags": {
         /* tag structure */
       },
       "confidence": {
         /* confidence scores */
       },
       "explanations": {
         "domain": "Selected 'software-development' based on discussion of programming techniques and code examples",
         "contextual_tag": "Suggested new tag 'state-management' because the conversation focuses on Redux, MobX, and similar approaches not covered by existing tags"
       }
     }
     ```

3. **Review Interface Integration**:
   - System generates a summary view of all tag assignments with confidence indicators
   - Quick approval workflow for batch acceptance of high-confidence tags
   - Detailed review interface for uncertain classifications
   - Tag editing capabilities with taxonomy validation

This framework balances automation efficiency with quality control, ensuring tag accuracy while minimizing manual review
requirements.

   tag-conversations tag ./conversations/ --mode=interactive

   # Force reprocessing of all files
   tag-conversations tag ./conversations/ --force
   ```

This workflow design provides maximum flexibility while maintaining efficiency for both individual file processing and
large-scale batch operations.

### Advanced Cost Management System

The CLI implements a sophisticated cost management and estimation system using OpenAI's official tokenization approach:

1. **Precise Token Estimation**:

   - Uses `tiktoken` (OpenAI's official tokenizer) for accurate token counting
   - Performs model-specific tokenization since different models count tokens differently
   - Pre-calculates token counts for all files before processing begins
   - Accounts for both prompt tokens and expected completion tokens
   - Example output:
     ```
     📊 Token Usage Estimate
     ├── Files to process: 128
     ├── Total input tokens: ~245,780
     ├── Estimated prompt tokens: ~267,350 (includes instructions)
     ├── Estimated completion tokens: ~15,360
     │
     ├── Model: gpt-3.5-turbo
     │   └── Estimated cost: $0.56 USD
     ├── Model: gpt-4-turbo-preview
     │   └── Estimated cost: $2.14 USD
     │
     ├── Recommended model for this batch: gpt-3.5-turbo
     │   (Classification tasks typically work well with this model)
     ```

2. **Intelligent Token Optimization**:

   - Implements token-saving strategies for long conversations:
     - Extracts key segments based on semantic importance
     - Summarizes lengthy sections while preserving topical indicators
     - Prioritizes conversation beginnings and conclusions
   - Provides token reduction statistics and estimated savings

3. **Real-time Cost Monitoring**:

   - Tracks actual API usage during processing
   - Compares real vs. estimated costs continuously
   - Implements configurable budget thresholds with automatic pausing
   - Displays running cost totals with model-specific breakdown

4. **Usage Analytics**:

   - Generates detailed cost and usage reports
   - Identifies token usage patterns and optimization opportunities
   - Tracks historical usage across runs
   - Example command:

     ```bash
     # View detailed token usage report
     tag-conversations stats --last-run

     # Export usage history to CSV
     tag-conversations stats --export=usage_report.csv
     ```

This system provides enterprise-grade cost management with minimal overhead, ensuring predictable and optimized API
usage.

### Intelligent Model Selection & Fallback System

     > gpt-3.5-turbo ($0.56 estimated) - Recommended for this batch size
       gpt-4-turbo-preview ($2.14 estimated) - Higher accuracy, 4× cost
       gpt-4 ($4.28 estimated) - Legacy model, not recommended

     Pro tip: Add --model=gpt-3.5-turbo to skip this prompt
     ```

2. **Multi-tiered Model Strategy**:

   - Support for specialized models per task type:
     ```bash
     # Use different models for different processing stages
     tag-conversations tag ./convos/ --summary-model=gpt-3.5-turbo --classification-model=gpt-4
     ```
   - Cost optimization using embeddings for pre-classification where applicable
   - Ability to fine-tune classification models on your specific taxonomy (optional)

3. **Intelligent Fallback System**:

   - Automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient errors
   - Model downgrading on quota limits (with permission)
   - Budget-aware processing with configurable thresholds:

     ```bash
     # Set maximum spend for this run
     tag-conversations tag ./convos/ --max-cost=5.00

     # Set action when approaching limit
     tag-conversations tag ./convos/ --on-limit=pause|warn|stop
     ```

4. **Advanced Quota Management**:
   - Proactive quota checking before batch processing
   - Real-time usage tracking against OpenAI rate limits

    }
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*", "config/**/*", "scripts/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]
}
```

#### Data Loading Best Practices

For the tag configurations and domain hierarchies, use TypeScript for type safety while keeping them easy to load:

1. **Domain and Subdomain Hierarchies**:
   - Store as JSON files for easy editing by users
   - Create TypeScript type definitions
   - Use a loader utility that validates against the types

```typescript
// src/utils/config-loader.ts
import * as fs from 'fs';
import * as path from 'path';

import type { Domain } from '@types/domains';

// src/types/domains.ts
export interface Domain {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  subdomains: Subdomain[];
}

export interface Subdomain {
  id: string;
  name: string;
}

export function loadDomains(filepath: string): Domain[] {
  try {
    const content = fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(filepath), 'utf-8');
    const domains = JSON.parse(content) as Domain[];
    return validateDomains(domains);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error loading domains from ${filepath}:`, error);
    return [];
  }
}

function validateDomains(domains: any[]): Domain[] {
  // Validation logic here
  return domains;
}
```

2. **Tag Constants**:
   - Define fixed tag sets in TypeScript
   - Use const assertions for type safety

```typescript
// config/default-tags.ts
export const CONVERSATION_TYPES = [
  'theory',
  'practical',
  'meta',
  'casual',
  'adhd-thought',
  'deep-dive',
  'exploration',
  'experimental',
  'reflection',
  'planning',
  'question',
  'analysis',
] as const;

export type ConversationType = (typeof CONVERSATION_TYPES)[number];

export const LIFE_AREAS = [
  'career',
  'relationships',
  'health',
  'learning',
  'projects',
  'personal-growth',
  'finance',
  'hobby',
] as const;

export type LifeArea = (typeof LIFE_AREAS)[number];
```

3. **Prompt Files**:
   - Store as plain text files
   - Use a template system to inject variables

```typescript
// src/utils/prompt-loader.ts
import * as fs from 'fs';
import * as path from 'path';

export function loadPrompt(promptName: string, variables: Record<string, string> = {}): string {
  try {
    const promptPath = path.resolve(`./prompts/${promptName}.txt`);
    let promptText = fs.readFileSync(promptPath, 'utf-8');

    // Replace template variables
    for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(variables)) {
      promptText = promptText.replace(new RegExp(`{{${key}}}`, 'g'), value);
    }

    return promptText;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error loading prompt ${promptName}:`, error);
    return '';
  }
}
```

### Code Organization Best Practices

1. **Modular Architecture**:

   - Separate core logic (tagging engine) from UI/CLI interfaces
   - Use dependency injection for testability
   - Create service interfaces for major components

2. **Type Safety**:

   - Use TypeScript interfaces and types for all data structures
   - Leverage discriminated unions for state management
   - Use Zod or io-ts for runtime validation

3. **Error Handling**:

   - Create custom error classes for different failure modes
   - Use Result pattern for operations that can fail
   - Implement global error boundaries

4. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Unit tests for core business logic
   - Integration tests for API interactions
   - E2E tests for CLI workflows
   - Mock OpenAI API for deterministic testing

This comprehensive setup provides an exceptional development environment with:

- Consistent code formatting and linting
- Integrated debugging
- Efficient build processes
- Type safety throughout
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy configuration management
- Comprehensive testing

## 6. ADVANCED IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES

### Large Files & Efficient Processing

- **Chunking Strategy**: Implement piecewise document processing following OpenAI's recommendation to "split complex
  tasks into simpler subtasks":

  - Process large conversations in meaningful semantic chunks (e.g., by conversation turns or topics)
  - Use a recursive summarization approach where chunks are processed independently, then results are combined
  - Set configurable maximum chunk sizes (e.g., 4K, 8K, 16K tokens depending on model)

- **Context Window Optimization**:

  - Implement token counting using tiktoken library for accurate token estimation
  - For very large files, extract the most relevant sections using embedding similarity
  - Use a sliding window approach for documents that exceed token limits

- **Performance Testing**:
  - Include a testing framework to measure accuracy vs. token usage tradeoffs
  - Implement A/B testing for different chunking strategies
  - Create visualization tools to understand how chunking affects tagging quality

### Advanced Rate Limit Handling & Optimization

- **Exponential Backoff with Jitter**:

  - Implement industry-standard exponential backoff with random jitter
  - Start with small delays (1-2s) that double with each retry attempt
  - Set configurable maximum retry attempts and maximum backoff time (e.g., 60s)

- **Rate Limit Management**:

  - Implement token rate tracking to stay below API quotas
  - Use client-side request batching and queuing for optimal throughput
  - Support concurrent processing with configurable concurrency limits

- **Tiered Fallback Strategy**:
  - If GPT-4 requests fail due to rate limits, fall back to GPT-3.5-Turbo
  - Allow specifying different models for different stages of processing
  - Implement circuit breaker pattern to prevent overwhelming the API during outages

### Comprehensive Error Handling

- **Error Classification & Response**:

  - Categorize errors into transient (retryable) vs. permanent (non-retryable)
  - Implement error-specific handling strategies (e.g., different approaches for rate limits vs. context length errors)
  - Create detailed error logs with timestamps, request IDs, and error contexts

- **Persistence & Recovery**:

  - Implement checkpointing to save progress during batch processing
  - Create a resume capability to continue processing from the last successful operation
  - Maintain a transaction log for audit and debugging purposes

- **Quality Assurance**:
  - Flag potentially problematic tagging results for human review
  - Implement confidence scoring for model outputs
  - Create reports of systematic errors to identify improvement opportunities

### Enhanced User Experience

- **Structured Logging Architecture**:

  - Implement hierarchical logging with multiple severity levels
  - Use structured JSON logs with consistent schema for machine readability
  - Include rich context in logs (file metadata, operation type, timestamps)

- **Interactive Progress Reporting**:

  - Implement real-time progress visualization with estimated completion time
  - Show token usage and cost metrics live during processing
  - Create a dashboard view for both CLI and plugin interfaces

- **Feedback Integration**:
  - Allow users to flag incorrect tags for future improvement
  - Implement a feedback collection mechanism to gather training examples
  - Create a quality improvement loop where user corrections improve system performance

### Enhanced Security Measures

- **Data Minimization**:

  - Implement optional preprocessing to remove PII (names, emails, phone numbers)
  - Create configurable content filters to redact sensitive information
  - Support local embedding/chunking to reduce data sent to OpenAI

- **Privacy Controls**:

  - Add opt-in configuration for data anonymization
  - Implement custom entity recognition to identify and mask sensitive data
  - Support local storage of sensitive content with only references sent to API

- **Security Best Practices**:
  - Follow OpenAI's safety best practices for prompt engineering
  - Implement API key rotation and secure storage
  - Add audit logging for all API operations

## 7. ADVANCED DATA PERSISTENCE & CONTEXT MANAGEMENT

The system requires a sophisticated data persistence layer to efficiently store tagging history, metadata, and
optimization data for future operations.

### High-Performance Persistence Architecture

#### Core Data Store Requirements

The system implements a multi-tier data persistence architecture optimized for:

1. **Speed**: Near-instantaneous read/write operations for high-throughput tagging

3. **Scalability**: Ability to handle millions of documents and tags
4. **Contextual Awareness**: Preservation of relationships between entities
5. **Query Performance**: Complex tag-based retrieval in sub-second time

#### Implementation Approach

The data store uses a hybrid approach with specialized storage mechanisms for different data types:

1. **Primary Storage Layer**:

   - **SQLite Database**: Core relational data with indexes optimized for tag-based queries
   - **LevelDB**: High-performance key-value store for embeddings and vector data
   - **JSON Files**: Human-readable configuration and taxonomy definitions

2. **In-Memory Cache Layer**:

   - **LRU Cache**: Frequently accessed tags and document metadata
   - **Vector Cache**: Computed embeddings for active documents
   - **Operation Cache**: Recent tagging operations for fast undo/redo

3. **Sync Mechanism**:
   - **Journal-based Write-Ahead Logging**: Guarantees consistency during crashes
   - **Incremental Sync**: Minimal data transfer during cloud synchronization
   - **Conflict Resolution**: Smart merging of concurrent modifications

### Contextual Data Model

#### Entity Relationships

The data model captures complex relationships between entities:

```
┌─────────────┐       ┌─────────────┐       ┌─────────────┐
│  Document   │───┬───│    Tags     │───────│  Taxonomy   │
└─────────────┘   │   └─────────────┘       └─────────────┘
                  │         │                      │
                  │         │                      │
┌─────────────┐   │   ┌─────────────┐       ┌─────────────┐
│  Embeddings │───┘   │  TagHistory │───────│ Classification│
└─────────────┘       └─────────────┘       └─────────────┘
      │                      │                     │
      │                      │                     │
┌─────────────┐       ┌─────────────┐       ┌─────────────┐
│ RAGContext  │───────│   Stats     │───────│ UserFeedback │
└─────────────┘       └─────────────┘       └─────────────┘
```

Key entities include:

1. **Document**: Core content objects with metadata and frontmatter
2. **Tags**: Applied classification labels with confidence scores
3. **Taxonomy**: Hierarchical category definitions and relationships
4. **Embeddings**: Vector representations for semantic matching
5. **TagHistory**: Complete version history of tag changes
6. **Classification**: AI model outputs with rationales
7. **RAGContext**: Retrieved context used for classification decisions
8. **Stats**: Performance metrics and usage statistics
9. **UserFeedback**: Corrections and preferences

### Optimization Strategies

#### Performance Optimizations
