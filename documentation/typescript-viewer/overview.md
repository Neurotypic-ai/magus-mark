# Description

You're now building a production-grade TypeScript tool that parses a real codebase (focused on TypeScript/JavaScript)
and performs the following tasks:

1. Track Dependencies and Symbols

   - It inspects external dependencies (e.g., package.json) as well as local packages/workspaces in a monorepo.
   - For each module, it records imports, exports, and significant constructs (classes, functions, enums, types,
     components) with a robust and unified id-based linking system (all identifiers are now labeled as 'id' rather than
     'uuid').
   - All entities (packages, modules, classes, interfaces, methods, parameters, properties) utilize a deterministic ID
     generation approach with native UUID support in DuckDB.
   - Many-to-many relationships (like implemented interfaces) use dedicated linking tables with their own ids.

2. Versioning Over Time

   - It ties its records to specific commits, capturing the evolution of files over time.
   - The database schema incorporates created_at timestamps on all tables to track these temporal changes.

3. Queryable Data Store

   - Data is stored in DuckDB with native UUID types and a denormalized schema including fields such as package_id,
     module_id, and parent_id.
   - Our Repository Interfaces now handle all data persistence, abstracting away direct database interactions.
   - The system supports efficient querying to retrieve complete graphs or subgraphs of code relationships.

4. Visualization and Time Dimension

   - Interactive visualization is powered by React Flow, while Memgraph supports fast in-memory graph operations for
     real-time analysis.
   - The tool maintains a history of changes on a commit-by-commit basis, presenting not only structural relationships
     but also their evolution.

5. Advanced Refactoring and AST-Based Analysis

   - It performs deep code transformation and refactoring based on historical context using AST tools like jscodeshift.
   - Normalizes varied import/export patterns and resolves circular dependencies with enhanced caching and error
     handling.

6. Production-Ready cli and Automation

   - A refined CLI built with Commander.js provides robust analysis and visualization commands.
   - The entire stack has been upgraded to transition away from sample data in App.tsx to a real integration with live
     codebases.

## Database Architecture

Our architecture now features:

- A unified naming convention using 'id' across all entities (packages, modules, classes, etc.), replacing the old
  'uuid' scheme.
- A denormalized schema in DuckDB that includes critical fields such as package_id, module_id, and parent_id, ensuring
  rapid query performance and data integrity.
- Repository interfaces that act as the single source of truth for CRUD operations, abstracting the underlying database
  adapter (DuckDB and DuckDB-Wasm).
- Enhanced error handling and transaction management, with native support for UUIDs and comprehensive indexing and
  foreign key constraints.
- A clear separation between parsing, data validation, and persistence, ensuring that live data from a real codebase is
  reliably ingested and stored.

## Query Scenarios & Technical Implementation

## Query Scenarios

Here are various ways you might want to query the stored information:

1. By Module or File

   - Fetch all versions of a given file or module over a specified time range.
   - See a file's external and internal dependencies at different points in history.
   - Optimized by the denormalized schema with package_id and module_id columns.

2. By Dependency or Symbol

   - Identify everywhere a certain package or symbol is used throughout the project.
   - Track how usage changes across commits.
   - Efficient querying through id-based relationships and linking tables.

3. Time-Ranged Analysis

   - Look at the state of the codebase between two dates/commits.
   - Generate a list of changes (added/removed/modified files, exports, imports, etc.) in that period.
   - Leverages created_at timestamps in all tables.

4. Commit-by-Commit Visualization

   - Step through the commit history to see how modules, functions, classes, etc., have evolved.
   - Compare snapshots at different commits.
   - Fast visualization through Memgraph's in-memory processing.

5. Impact Analysis

   - Identify all downstream dependencies that might be affected by changes to a given file or symbol.
   - Check how a refactor or rename trickles through the codebase over time.
   - Efficient traversal through denormalized schema and id-based relationships.

6. Graph or Subgraph Retrieval
   - Retrieve an entire project dependency graph at a certain commit.
   - Drill down into subsets of the graph, such as a single workspace or set of related modules.
   - Fast graph operations through Memgraph after initial data load.

## Technical Implementation

The tool is implemented using modern TypeScript and leverages several key technologies:

1. Storage Layer

   - DuckDB for persistent storage with native UUID support
   - Denormalized schema for query optimization
   - Separate linking tables for many-to-many relationships
   - Memgraph for in-memory graph operations

2. Parser Layer

   - jscodeshift for AST analysis
   - Custom parsers for different TypeScript constructs
   - Efficient id generation using UUID v5

3. Visualization Layer

   - React Flow for interactive visualization
   - Material-UI for component styling
   - Mermaid for static diagram generation

4. CLI Interface
   - Commander.js for command-line parsing
   - Support for analysis and visualization commands
