> > Here’s a simple example of a `package.json` setup for a Yarn workspace:
> >
> > ### Root `package.json`
> >
> > ```json
> > {
> >   "private": true,

> >   "dependencies": {
> >     "typescript": "^4.5.2"
> >   }

> >
> > ### Child Workspace `package.json` (`packages/child-package`)
> >
> > ```json
> > {
> >   "name": "child-package",
> >   "version": "1.0.0",
> >   "dependencies": {
> >     // other dependencies specific to this package
> >   }
> > }
> > ```
> >
> > In this setup, `typescript` is declared in the root `package.json`, making it available to all workspaces under
> > `packages/*`.
> >
> > ### Best Practices
> >
> > 1.  **Version Synchronization**: Ensure the versions of dependencies like TypeScript are compatible across all your
> >     workspaces to avoid potential conflicts.
> > 2.  **Consistency**: Keep your dependencies as consistent as possible between the root and child workspaces to
> >     simplify dependency management.
> > 3.  **Testing**: Regularly test your setup to ensure that all dependencies are correctly hoisted and available where
> >     needed.
> >
> > By following these guidelines, you can manage your dependencies effectively within a Yarn workspace setup.

> > Hoisting in Yarn workspaces refers to the process where dependencies that are common across multiple packages are
> > moved to the root `node_modules` directory. This helps in reducing duplication and managing dependencies more
> > efficiently. However, there are certain limitations and situations where hoisting might not work as expected. Here
> > are the key hoisting limitations and their implications:
> >
> > ### 1. **Version Conflicts**
> >
> > When multiple packages in the workspace depend on different versions of the same dependency, Yarn cannot hoist a
> > single version to the root. Instead, it will place the specific versions needed by each package in their respective
> > `node_modules` directories.
> >
> > **Implication**: This can lead to multiple versions of the same dependency being installed across your workspace,
> > potentially increasing the overall size of `node_modules` and causing inconsistencies if the packages interact.
> >
> > ### Example
> >
> > ```json
> > // packages/packageA/package.json
> > {
> >   "dependencies": {
> >     "lodash": "4.17.21"
> >   }
> > }
> >
> > // packages/packageB/package.json
> > {
> >   "dependencies": {
> >     "lodash": "4.16.6"
> >   }
> > }
> > ```
> >
> > In this case, both versions of `lodash` will be installed separately in `packageA` and `packageB`'s `node_modules`
> > directories.
> >
> > ### 2. **Peer Dependencies**
> >
> > Peer dependencies are not hoisted. They must be resolved at the level where they are declared.
> >
> > **Implication**: If a package declares a peer dependency, the consuming package must explicitly declare and install
> > that peer dependency at the appropriate level.
> >
> > ### Example
> >
> > ```json
> > // packages/packageA/package.json
> > {
> >   "peerDependencies": {
> >     "react": "^17.0.0"
> >   }
> > }
> >
> > // root package.json
> > {
> >   "dependencies": {
> >     "react": "^17.0.0"
> >   }
> > }
> > ```
> >
> > `react` must be declared at the root or in the consuming package’s `package.json` to satisfy the peer dependency.
> >
> > ### 3. **Optional Dependencies**
> >
> > Optional dependencies are also not hoisted. They remain in the `node_modules` of the package that declares them.
> >
> > **Implication**: If a package declares an optional dependency, it will only be installed if the environment supports
> > it, and it won't be hoisted to the root.
> >
> > ### Example
> >
> > ```json
> > // packages/packageA/package.json
> > {
> >   "optionalDependencies": {
> >     "fsevents": "^2.3.2"
> >   }
> > }
> > ```
> >
> > `fsevents` will only be installed within `packageA`'s `node_modules` if the operating system supports it (e.g.,
> > macOS).
> >
> > ### 4. **NoHoist Field**
> >
> > Yarn workspaces allow you to explicitly prevent certain dependencies from being hoisted using the `nohoist` field.
> >
> > **Implication**: This can be used to ensure that specific dependencies are always installed within the workspace
> > package’s `node_modules` and not hoisted to the root.
> >
> > ### Example
> >
> > ```json
> > // root package.json
> > {
> >   "workspaces": {
> >     "packages": ["packages/*"],
> >     "nohoist": ["**/lodash"]
> >   }
> > }
> > ```
> >
> > `lodash` will not be hoisted and will remain in each package's `node_modules`.
> >
> > ### 5. **Transitive Dependencies**
> >
> > Dependencies of dependencies (transitive dependencies) may not be hoisted if they have version conflicts or if the
> > parent dependency declares them in a way that prevents hoisting.
> >
> > **Implication**: This can lead to nested `node_modules` structures, where dependencies are duplicated across
> > packages.
> >
> > ### Example
> >
> > ```json
> > // packages/packageA/package.json
> > {
> >   "dependencies": {
> >     "axios": "^0.21.1"
> >   }
> > }
> >
> > // axios package.json
> > {
> >   "dependencies": {
> >     "follow-redirects": "^1.14.0"
> >   }
> > }
> > ```
> >
> > If `follow-redirects` has a version conflict with another package, it might not be hoisted and will remain nested
> > under `axios`.
> >
> > ### Conclusion
> >
> > Understanding these limitations helps in managing dependencies more effectively within a Yarn workspace setup. By
> > being aware of how and when hoisting occurs, you can design your workspace to minimize duplication, avoid conflicts,
> > and ensure that dependencies are available where needed.

> Explain the difference between hoisting in yarn1 and yarn4

<!-- UID: bf9c9bf5-8bdb-4995-95ce-d1d3b3470b57 -->

> > The concept of hoisting has evolved from Yarn v1 to Yarn v4, with several improvements and changes. Below is a
> > comparison highlighting the key differences between hoisting in Yarn v1 and Yarn v4:
> >
> > ### Yarn v1
> >
> > 1.  **Basic Hoisting**
> >     - In Yarn v1, hoisting aims to move dependencies as high up in the directory structure as possible, typically to
> >       the root `node_modules` directory.
> >     - This reduces duplication but can lead to conflicts and complex dependency resolution.
> > 2.  **Hoisting Conflicts**
> >     - When multiple packages require different versions of the same dependency, Yarn v1 might end up duplicating
> >       those dependencies within the respective packages' `node_modules` directories.
> >     - This can lead to inconsistencies and issues where different parts of the project might use different versions
> >       of the same library.
> > 3.  **Peer Dependencies**
> >     - Yarn v1 does not hoist peer dependencies. They must be resolved by the consuming package.
> >     - This often requires manual intervention to ensure that peer dependencies are correctly declared and installed.
> > 4.  **Optional Dependencies**
> >     - Optional dependencies are also not hoisted and remain within the package that declares them.
> >     - This helps to avoid unnecessary installations on platforms that do not support those optional dependencies.
> > 5.  **NoHoist Configuration**
> >     - Yarn v1 introduced a `nohoist` configuration to explicitly prevent certain dependencies from being hoisted.
> >     - This allows more granular control over the hoisting behavior, ensuring specific dependencies stay within their
> >       declaring packages.
> >
> > ### Example of `nohoist` in Yarn v1
> >
> > ```json
> > {
> >   "workspaces": {
> >     "packages": ["packages/*"],
> >     "nohoist": ["**/lodash"]
> >   }
> > }
> > ```
> >
> > ### Yarn v4
> >
> > 1.  **Plug'n'Play (PnP)**
> >     - Yarn v4 introduces Plug'n'Play (PnP) as the default installation strategy, which fundamentally changes how
> >       dependencies are resolved.
> >     - PnP eliminates the need for a `node_modules` directory, instead creating a single `.pnp.cjs` file that keeps
> >       track of where each dependency is located.
> >     - This drastically reduces installation time and disk usage by avoiding duplicate installations.
> > 2.  **Improved Dependency Resolution**
> >     - PnP in Yarn v4 ensures that each package gets the exact version of dependencies it requires without conflicts,
> >       as dependencies are not hoisted in the traditional sense.
> >     - This leads to a more predictable and consistent dependency tree.
> > 3.  **No More `nohoist`**
> >     - With the elimination of `node_modules`, the `nohoist` configuration is no longer necessary. PnP ensures that
> >       all dependencies are resolved correctly without manual intervention.
> > 4.  **Better Error Reporting**
> >     - Yarn v4 provides enhanced error reporting for dependency conflicts, making it easier to understand and resolve
> >       issues related to incompatible versions.
> > 5.  **Performance and Efficiency**
> >     - Yarn v4's PnP model significantly improves performance, as it avoids the overhead of creating and managing a
> >       large `node_modules` directory.
> >     - Dependency lookups are faster and more efficient, leading to quicker start times and lower memory usage.
> >
> > ### Example of Yarn v4 Configuration
> >
> > Yarn v4 does not require special configurations for hoisting, as PnP handles everything automatically. A basic
> > workspace configuration might look like this:
> >
> > ```json
> > {
> >   "workspaces": ["packages/*"]
> > }
> > ```
> >
> > ### Summary
> >
> > - **Yarn v1**: Traditional hoisting with potential conflicts, duplication, and the need for `nohoist`
> >   configurations.
> > - **Yarn v4**: PnP model that eliminates `node_modules`, providing a more efficient and conflict-free dependency
> >   resolution mechanism without the need for hoisting configurations.
> >
> > These changes in Yarn v4 represent a significant shift towards more efficient and reliable dependency management,
> > addressing many of the limitations and complexities present in Yarn v1.

> >
> > 1.  **Basic Hoisting Behavior**
> >     - Dependencies are hoisted to the topmost `node_modules` directory possible, aiming to reduce duplication.
> >     - Yarn tries to place shared dependencies in the root `node_modules` directory if there are no conflicts.

> >     - Improved algorithms in Yarn v4 help in better conflict resolution and more efficient dependency tree
> >       management.
> > 3.  **Peer Dependencies**
> >     - Peer dependencies still need to be resolved by the consuming packages and are not hoisted.
