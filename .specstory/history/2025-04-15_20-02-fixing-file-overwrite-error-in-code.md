# Fixing File Overwrite Error in Code (2025-04-15 16:02:15)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Cannot write file '/Users/khallmark/Desktop/Code/obsidian-magic/config/eslint/base.js' because it would overwrite input file.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Your Grace, 

The error suggests TypeScript is trying to compile config files. The solution is to specify the files to be included in compilation while excluding config files.

---

```diff
    "compilerOptions": {
      "tsBuildInfoFile": "./dist/core.tsbuildinfo"
-   }
+   },
+   "include": ["src/**/*"],
+   "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist", "**/*.spec.ts", "**/*.test.ts"]
  }
  
```

---

This should resolve the error by explicitly telling TypeScript to only compile files within the src directory and to exclude configuration files, preventing it from trying to overwrite input files.

I removed all my files/include/dir stuff from my @base.json . I moved them to @lib.json . Refine the list in @lib.json and then update @test.json as needed. You'll also need to add some stuff to the root @tsconfig.json . 

Make sure to fix this:
