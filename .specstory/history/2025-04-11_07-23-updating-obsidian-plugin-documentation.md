# Updating Obsidian Plugin Documentation (2025-04-11 03:23:27)

_**User**_

@obsidian-plugin is out of date with the rest of my @documentation. @Obsidian @Obsidian API @Obsidian VSCode can help provide context. Assure that all referenced files are available and complete. 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Your Lordship, I'll check the Obsidian plugin documentation to ensure all referenced files exist and are complete.

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory documentation/obsidian-plugin â€¢ **3** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| ðŸ“„ `document-integration.md` |
| ðŸ“„ `tag-management.md` |
| ðŸ“„ `plugin-overview.md` |

</details>

---

I notice that in the plugin-overview.md file, there are references to files that don't appear to exist in the directory:
- security-configuration.md
- ecosystem-integration.md

Let me examine the plugin overview file to understand what's expected:

---

Read file: documentation/obsidian-plugin/plugin-overview.md

---

Let me check if document-integration.md is complete:

---

Read file: documentation/obsidian-plugin/document-integration.md

---

Let me also check what other documentation directories contain to get a better understanding of the project structure:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory documentation/cli â€¢ **3** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| ðŸ“„ `cost-management.md` |
| ðŸ“„ `command-structure.md` |
| ðŸ“„ `cli-overview.md` |

</details>

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory documentation/vscode-integration â€¢ **2** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| ðŸ“„ `vscode-features.md` |
| ðŸ“„ `vscode-overview.md` |

</details>

| ðŸ“„ `dependency-injection.md` |
| ðŸ“„ `error-handling.md` |
| ðŸ“„ `build-system.md` |

</details>

Based on my analysis, I need to create two missing files:
1. security-configuration.md
2. ecosystem-integration.md

Let me create these files:

Your Grace, I have updated your Obsidian plugin documentation to ensure all referenced files now exist and are complete. The two missing files have been created:

1. security-configuration.md - Covering API key management, permissions, privacy features, and security best practices
2. ecosystem-integration.md - Detailing integration with Obsidian core features and the wider plugin ecosystem

Both files follow the same documentation style as your existing files, with comprehensive section organization and bullet-point feature lists. All files referenced in plugin-overview.md are now available:
- tag-management.md (already existed)
- document-integration.md (already existed)
- security-configuration.md (newly created)
- ecosystem-integration.md (newly created)

These additions ensure your Obsidian plugin documentation is now consistent with the rest of your project documentation.

Your Humble Servant, Sebastien

Add enough fidelity to the documents so they can be implemented by a mid-level developer

Your Lordship, I'll enhance the document-integration.md file with implementation specifics for mid-level developers.
