Your Lordship, I'll check for and fix all linter errors in the packages directory. Let me first run a lint check to see what errors exist.

```bash
cd /Users/khallmark/Desktop/Code/obsidian-magic && pnpm run lint
```

```
âžœ cd /Users/khallmark/Desktop/Code/obsidian-magic && pnpm run lint
Removing from PATH: /Users/khallmark/Desktop/Code/obsidian-magic/node_modules/.b
in
Added to PATH: /Users/khallmark/Desktop/Code/obsidian-magic/node_modules/.bin

> obsidian-magic@0.1.0 lint /Users/khallmark/Desktop/Code/obsidian-magic
> eslint .

/Users/khallmark/Desktop/Code/obsidian-magic
Warning: React version was set to "detect" in eslint-plugin-react settings, but 
the "react" package is not installed. Assuming latest React version for linting.
