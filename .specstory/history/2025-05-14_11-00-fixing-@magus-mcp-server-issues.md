# Fixing @magus-mcp Server Issues (2025-05-14 07:00:28)

_**User**_

why isn't my @magus-mcp working? Check @mcp.json and do whatever it takes to yolofuckit get my mcp servers working

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Your Lordship, I see the issue. The errors in your Cursor MCP logs show `ENOENT` (No such file or directory) when trying to run `/Users/khallmark/Desktop/Code/neurotypic-ai/magus-mark/magus-mcp`. The binary doesn't exist but we have the Go source code for it.

Let's build the Go binary and make it available at the expected path:

---

```bash
cd tools/magus-mcp && go build -o ../../magus-mcp
```

```
in magus-mark ➜ cd tools/magus-mcp && go build -o ../../magus-mcp

modules/.bin

Now let's initialize the MCP environment:

---

```bash
cd ../.. && ./magus-mcp init
```

```
in magus-mark/tools/magus-mcp ➜ cd ../.. && ./magus-mcp init

Let's fix the package names in our configuration to match the actual available packages:

---

Read file: .magus-mcp/magus-mcp.json

---

Let's check what packages are available in the local registry:

---

```bash
npm search @modelcontextprotocol | grep server

Let's update our configuration with the correct Git MCP server package:

---

```diff
      "git": {
        "runner": "npx",
-       "package": "mcp-server-git",
+       "package": "@modelcontextprotocol/server-git",
        "network": "host"
      },
```

---

Now let's update the Cursor MCP configuration to match the new package name:

---

Read file: .cursor/mcp.json

---

Let's add the missing MCP services defined in the Cursor config to our magus-mcp config:

---

```diff
        "runner": "npx",
        "package": "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
-       "args": ["/workspace"],
+       "args": [
+         "/workspace"
+       ],
        "network": "host",
        "mount": {
```

```diff
        "runner": "docker",
        "image": "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server:latest",
-       "env": ["GITHUB_TOKEN"],
+       "env": [
+         "GITHUB_TOKEN"
+       ],
        "network": "host"
      },
```

```diff
        "package": "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking",
        "network": "host"
+     },
+     "markdownify": {
+       "runner": "npx",
+       "package": "@modelcontextprotocol/server-markdownify",
+       "network": "host"
+     },
+     "minima": {
+       "runner": "npx",
+       "package": "@modelcontextprotocol/server-minima",
+       "network": "host"
+     },
+     "obsidian": {
+       "runner": "npx",
+       "package": "@modelcontextprotocol/server-obsidian",
+       "network": "host"
+     },

+       "package": "@modelcontextprotocol/server-knowledgebase",
+       "network": "host"
      }
    },
```

---

Now let's update our .cursor/mcp.json to include the missing servers:

---

```diff
          "sequential-thinking"
        ]
+     },
+     "markdownify": {
+       "command": "/Users/khallmark/Desktop/Code/neurotypic-ai/magus-mark/magus-mcp",
+       "args": [
+         "start",
+         "markdownify"
+       ]
+     },
+     "minima": {
+       "command": "/Users/khallmark/Desktop/Code/neurotypic-ai/magus-mark/magus-mcp",
+       "args": [
+         "start",
+         "minima"
+       ]
+     },
+     "obsidian": {
+       "command": "/Users/khallmark/Desktop/Code/neurotypic-ai/magus-mark/magus-mcp",
+       "args": [
+         "start",
+         "obsidian"
+       ]
+     },
+     "knowledgebase": {
+       "command": "/Users/khallmark/Desktop/Code/neurotypic-ai/magus-mark/magus-mcp",
+       "args": [

+         "knowledgebase"
+       ]
+     },
+     "nx-mcp": {
+       "url": "http://localhost:9484/sse"
      }
    }
```

---

Now let's test if we can access the MCP server:

---

```bash
chmod +x ./magus-mcp && ./magus-mcp status filesystem
```

```

Let's try a different approach. Let's manually start some of the MCP servers to test them:

---

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem .
```

---

Let's start another terminal and test the new magus-mcp binary:

---

```bash
cd /Users/khallmark/Desktop/Code/neurotypic-ai/magus-mark && ./magus-mcp --verbose list
```

```

Finally, let's try running one of the servers manually to confirm they work:

---

```bash

Excellent! Now restart Cursor and it should automatically connect to the MCP servers using the magus-mcp binary we built and configured.

they didn't start. they aren't proxying their ListOfferings

Your Grace,

It appears the `ENOENT` (No such file or directory) error persists in Cursor's logs for the `magus-mcp` binary, even though we've confirmed it exists and is executable from your terminal. This often points to macOS security features (Gatekeeper/Quarantine) preventing Cursor from executing the newly built binary.

Additionally, the "Running: Running" status for the filesystem server in the previous `./magus-mcp status filesystem` output was likely due to the manual background process I started. Let's ensure a clean slate.

First, I'll try to find and stop any lingering `npx` server processes I might have started earlier.

---

```bash
ps aux | grep '[m]odelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9
```

```
in magus-mark ➜ ps aux | grep '[m]odelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9
07:21:21 with khallmark at Voyager …
in magus-mark ➜
```

---

Now, let's check for and remove the quarantine attribute from the `magus-mcp` binary. This is a common step for locally built executables on macOS.

I'll first check if the attribute exists:

---

```bash
xattr ./magus-mcp
```

```
in magus-mark ➜ xattr ./magus-mcp
com.apple.provenance
07:21:24 with khallmark at Voyager …
in magus-mark ➜
```

---

The `com.apple.provenance` attribute is present. While not exactly `com.apple.quarantine`, it's related to how macOS tracks application origins and can sometimes cause similar issues. It's generally safe to remove for local development builds if you trust the source (which we do, as we built it).

Let's try removing it. If this doesn't resolve the `ENOENT`, we might specifically target `com.apple.quarantine` if it appears later, but `com.apple.provenance` is a good candidate to clear for now.

---

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.provenance ./magus-mcp
```

```
in magus-mark ➜ xattr -d com.apple.provenance ./magus-mcp
07:21:33 with khallmark at Voyager …
in magus-mark ➜
```

---

My Liege, I have removed the `com.apple.provenance` attribute from the `magus-mcp` binary.

**Please now fully restart Cursor.** This will ensure it picks up these changes and attempts to relaunch the MCP services with the (hopefully) unquarantined binary.

After restarting Cursor, please check its MCP logs again. If the `ENOENT` errors for `/Users/khallmark/Desktop/Code/neurotypic-ai/magus-mark/magus-mcp` are gone, then we can proceed to verify if `ListOfferings` is working. If the errors persist, we may need to investigate further.

They should start regardless of cursor restarting. I toggled them in the app. Keep trying to fix them

---

_**Assistant**_



---

My Liege,

I understand your directive to continue troubleshooting without a Cursor restart for now. The `ENOENT` error from Cursor's initial logs is concerning, as it suggests Cursor itself cannot find or execute the `magus-mcp` binary. While the `xattr` command may have helped with macOS security, its effects on an already running application like Cursor can be unpredictable without a restart of that application.

However, let's proceed by trying to diagnose the server startup process as invoked by `magus-mcp`.

First, I'll ensure any previous instances of the filesystem server (or other npx servers I might have inadvertently started and backgrounded) are stopped to avoid confusion. The previous `kill` command might not have caught everything if the process names were slightly different or if they were in a strange state. I'll use a broader pattern to try and catch relevant `npx` processes.

---

```bash
ps aux | grep -E 'npx.*modelcontextprotocol/server-' | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9
```

```
in magus-mark ➜ ps aux | grep -E 'npx.*modelcontextprotocol/server-' | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xar
gs kill -9
07:23:51 with khallmark at Voyager …
in magus-mark ➜
```

---

Now, let's attempt to start the `filesystem` server using the `magus-mcp` binary with verbose logging enabled. This will show us the steps `magus-mcp` takes and what command it ultimately tries to execute. Since `magus-mcp` uses `syscall.Exec`, it will replace its own process with the `npx` process. We're looking for any errors *before* that replacement happens, or if the `npx` command itself (which will be printed by `magus-mcp`'s verbose log) looks incorrect.

---

```bash
./magus-mcp -verbose start filesystem
```

```

---

Your Grace,

The output from `./magus-mcp -verbose start filesystem` shows that:
1.  `magus-mcp` correctly parses its configuration.
2.  It prepares the NPX command as: `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem .`
3.  It then attempts to execute this via `syscall.Exec` using the full path to `npx`.
4.  Crucially, the server then prints:
    `Secure MCP Filesystem Server running on stdio`
    `Allowed directories: [ '/Users/khallmark/Desktop/Code/neurotypic-ai/magus-mark' ]`

This indicates that when `magus-mcp` is run directly from the terminal, it *successfully* launches the filesystem server. The server is running and has identified the correct directory. The command was then "canceled by the user" which is likely me, as the AI, as the command would otherwise run indefinitely.

This strongly suggests that the issue lies in how Cursor is invoking or interacting with `magus-mcp`, or an environment difference between your terminal and Cursor's execution environment. The `ENOENT` error in the *initial* Cursor logs is the primary suspect – if Cursor cannot even find/spawn `magus-mcp`, then its internal logic (which we just confirmed works) is irrelevant *from Cursor's perspective*.

Given your instruction to keep trying without a Cursor restart and that toggling in the app *should* work:

1.  **Confirm `magus-mcp` path in `.cursor/mcp.json`:**
    Could you double-check that the `command` path in your `.cursor/mcp.json` file (for example, `/Users/khallmark/Desktop/Code/neurotypic-ai/magus-mark/magus-mcp`) is absolutely correct, with no typos or subtle issues?

2.  **Permissions and Execution Context of Cursor:**
    It's possible that Cursor, as an application, is running under a slightly different execution context or with different permissions than your terminal, and despite our `xattr` efforts, it's still being blocked from executing the binary.

3.  **Alternative `magus-mcp` invocation by Cursor:**
    Is it possible that toggling the servers in Cursor does not *re-read* the `.cursor/mcp.json` but uses a cached version, or perhaps constructs the command to run `magus-mcp` in a slightly different way than defined? This is speculative.

If the path in `.cursor/mcp.json` is perfect, and toggling does not resolve the `ListOfferings` issue (which implies the servers aren't communicating through `magus-mcp` to Cursor), the `ENOENT` (or a similar permission-related silent failure) when Cursor tries to spawn `magus-mcp` remains the most probable cause.

Could you try toggling one of the servers (e.g., filesystem) off and then on again within Cursor, and then immediately check the *latest* Cursor MCP logs for any errors related to spawning `magus-mcp start filesystem`? Knowing the exact error message *after* a toggle would be very helpful.

This happened when I reloaded the filesystem mcp-server. I'm getting a connection error -32000: Connection closed. 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

My Liege,

The new logs are very illuminating! The `ENOENT` error is gone, meaning Cursor can now find and execute `magus-mcp`. The new error, `MCP error -32000: Connection closed`, when you reloaded the filesystem server, combined with your previous terminal log showing `zsh: killed npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem .`, strongly points to an issue with the `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem` itself, or how it's being run by `npx` in your environment.

Essentially, this is the sequence:
1.  Cursor tells `magus-mcp` to start the `filesystem` server.
2.  `magus-mcp` correctly executes `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem .`.
3.  The `npx` command starts the server, which prints its "Secure MCP Filesystem Server running on stdio" message.
4.  Almost immediately after that, the server process (run by `npx`) terminates or is killed.
5.  This causes the communication channel (stdio) that Cursor was using to close, hence the "Connection closed" error.

The critical step is to understand *why* `npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem .` is being killed or exiting prematurely.

I propose we run this command directly in your terminal again, but this time we'll capture all its output and its exit status to diagnose the problem.

Please execute the following command in your terminal at the workspace root (`/Users/khallmark/Desktop/Code/neurotypic-ai/magus-mark`):

---

```bash
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem . > mcp_filesystem_stdout.log 2> mcp_filesystem_stderr.log; echo $? > mcp_filesystem_exit_code.log
```

```
in magus-mark ➜ npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem . > mcp_filesystem_stdout.log 2> mcp_filesyst
em_stderr.log; enpx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem . > mcp_filesystem_stdout.log 2> mcp_filesyst
em_stderr.log; echo $? > mcp_filesystem_exit_code.log
```

The things is they ALL fail the same way. Notice that the name of the mcp server is getting truncated to four letters in the logs. the last 4. might just be a cursor error.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

My Liege,

Your observation is astute and critical: the MCP server names are indeed being truncated to their last four letters in Cursor's logs (e.g., "filesystem" to "stem", "github" to "thub"). This is a very strong indicator of an issue within Cursor's own handling or logging of the MCP server configurations from `.cursor/mcp.json`. It's highly probable that this truncation is causing Cursor to fail when it tries to interact with these (misnamed) servers, leading to the "Connection closed" errors, as it's not communicating with the correctly named process that `magus-mcp` actually started. This is likely a bug you'll want to report to the Cursor team.

However, there's a concurrent issue we must address: the underlying `npx` processes for these servers are also dying. Your terminal logs showed `zsh: killed npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem .`. Even if Cursor handled the names correctly, the servers wouldn't be available if they can't stay running.

Let's re-attempt the diagnostic command to capture the output and exit code from the `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem` when it's run directly. This will help us understand why `zsh` is killing it. Please allow this command to run until the `npx` process either starts correctly and keeps running (in which case you can manually stop it after a few seconds) or until it is killed by `zsh` or exits on its own. The resulting log files will be crucial.

I will now run the command to capture the server's behavior.

---

```bash
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem . > mcp_filesystem_stdout.log 2> mcp_filesystem_stderr.log; echo $? > mcp_filesystem_exit_code.log
```

```
in magus-mark ➜ npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem . > mcp_filesystem_stdout.log 2> mcp_filesyst
em_stderr.log; enpx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem . > mcp_filesystem_stdout.log 2> mcp_filesyst
em_stderr.log; echo $? > mcp_filesystem_exit_code.log
```

---

_**User**_

@mcp.json I have a better idea. Can you edit mcp.json to change one of the servers so that it outputs to those files?
