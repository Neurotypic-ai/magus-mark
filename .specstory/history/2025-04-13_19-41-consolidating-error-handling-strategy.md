# Consolidating Error Handling Strategy (2025-04-13 15:41:00)

_**User**_

Do NOT mock the result class. Take a step back and think about this more carefully. We want one single version of a Result. We have our correct one in @errors.ts and two fake ones in @errors.ts and @errors.ts . We even test it in @errors.test.ts . Let's merge ALL the random error types in @obsidian-plugin and @cli into our @core implementation. Before we write and code or make any changes, we need a list of all the things we have to change in both apps. Analyze the codebase, list all the places we need to upgrade and tell me the plan to fix it without changing any code.

Your Lordship,

After analyzing the codebase, I've identified the core issue: we have three competing implementations of the `Result` pattern across different packages, causing type conflicts and duplication.

## Current State

1. **Core Implementation** (canonical):
   - `packages/core/src/errors.ts` - Complete `Result<T, E extends Error>` class with extensive methods

2. **CLI Implementation** (duplicate):
   - `apps/cli/src/types/errors.ts` - Simplified `Result<T>` class with fewer methods

3. **Obsidian Plugin Implementation** (completely different):
   - `apps/obsidian-plugin/src/services/errors.ts` - Interface-based `Result<T>` with different pattern

## Required Changes

### 1. CLI Package Updates
- Remove local `Result` class from `apps/cli/src/types/errors.ts`
- Import `Result` and error classes from `@obsidian-magic/core`
- Update error handling pattern to match core implementation

### 2. Obsidian Plugin Updates
- Remove local `Result` interface from `apps/obsidian-plugin/src/services/errors.ts`
- Replace `success`/`failure` helper functions with core implementations
- Import core error classes and `Result` class
- Convert error handling to use core pattern 

### 3. Test File Updates
- `apps/obsidian-plugin/tests/services/TaggingService.test.ts`: Use actual `Result` class instead of mocking
- `apps/obsidian-plugin/tests/services/errors.test.ts`: Update tests to verify core implementations

### 4. Type Definition Updates
- Update `FileProcessingResult` type to use core `Result` implementation
- Fix linter errors with proper type casting where needed

## Implementation Strategy

1. First implement CLI updates (simpler transition)
2. Then implement Obsidian plugin updates (more complex refactoring)
3. Finally fix tests to match new implementations

This approach ensures we maintain a single source of truth for error handling while minimizing breaking changes.

Your Humble Servant, Sebastien
