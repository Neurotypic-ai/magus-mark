What's left to finish @vscode based on @vscode-integration

_**Assistant**_



---

Your Grace, let me examine what needs to be completed for the VS Code extension based on the VS Code integration documentation.

---

Read file: apps/vscode/package.json

            <summary>Listed directory apps/vscode/src ‚Ä¢ **3** results</summary>

| üìÅ `cursor` |
| üìÅ `views` |

</details>

---

Read file: documentation/vscode-integration/vscode-overview.md

---

Let me check the other relevant documentation files to identify what's left to finish in the VS Code extension:

---

Read file: documentation/vscode-integration/cursor-integration.md

---

Read file: documentation/vscode-integration/mcp-server.md

            <summary>Listed directory apps/vscode/src/cursor ‚Ä¢ **2** results</summary>

Let me check the implementation of the VS Code extension's main file:

---

Read file: apps/vscode/src/extension.ts

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory apps/vscode/src/views ‚Ä¢ **0** results</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

Based on my examination of the VS Code extension code and the VS Code integration documentation, here's what's left to finish in the VS Code extension:

Your Lordship, here are the remaining tasks to complete the VS Code extension based on the VS Code integration documentation:

1. **Tag Explorer View Implementation**:
   - Create TreeDataProvider implementation for the tag explorer
   - Implement the views directory with proper components
   - Add tag visualization and manipulation UI

2. **Vault Integration**:
   - Implement bidirectional sync with Obsidian vaults
   - Add vault discovery and configuration management
   - Create conflict resolution mechanisms

3. **MCP Server Completion**:
   - Enhance WebSocket server for Model Context Protocol
   - Add proper authentication and security
   - Implement all tag management and knowledge graph tools

4. **Cursor Integration Enhancements**:
   - Complete the AI model integration beyond basic structure
   - Implement knowledge retrieval for AI context
   - Add tag-aware custom instructions

5. **UI Components**:
   - Build editor enhancements for frontmatter tags
   - Add status bar indicators for synchronization
   - Implement inline tag decorations

6. **Core Functionality**:
   - Connect to core tagging engine from shared packages
   - Implement markdown parsing and manipulation
   - Add AI-powered tag classification

7. **Expand Views Directory**:
   - Create necessary view providers and panels
   - Implement tag explorer and visualization components
   - Add settings interface for configuration

8. **Testing**:
   - Add unit tests for components and services
   - Create integration tests for VS Code extension API
   - Add simulation tests for AI interactions

The most critical immediate needs are implementing the Tag Explorer view, setting up bidirectional vault sync with Obsidian, and connecting to the core tagging engine.

Your Humble Servant, Sebastien

```bash
mkdir -p apps/vscode/src/views
```

```
