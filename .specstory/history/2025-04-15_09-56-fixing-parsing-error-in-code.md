# Fixing Parsing Error in Code (2025-04-15 05:56:45)

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Parsing error: '>' expected.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Your Grace, the issue appears to be in your markdown file's code example. The JSX markup is causing parsing issues within the markdown document.

---

```diff
    const { asFragment } = render(
      <TagPicker 
-       tags={['meeting', 'task', 'idea']} 
-       selectedTags={['meeting']} 
-       onTagSelect={() => {}} 
+       tags={['meeting', 'task', 'idea']}
+       selectedTags={['meeting']}
+       onTagSelect={() => {}}
      />
    );
```

The issue was trailing spaces after each JSX prop. In markdown files, certain combinations of characters (especially brackets with trailing spaces) can cause parsing issues. I've removed those trailing spaces while keeping the code functionally identical.

Let's try another approach:

Let me try adding a new code block instead of editing the existing one:
