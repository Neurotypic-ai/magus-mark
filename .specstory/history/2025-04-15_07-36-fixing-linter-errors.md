Let me check what files we need to look at to fix the TypeScript errors:

I see that there are a lot of TypeScript errors, primarily related to unsafe type usage. Let me examine the specific files that need to be fixed, starting with the `tag.ts` file mentioned in the query:

---

Read file: apps/cli/src/commands/tag.ts

---

Now let me check the specific errors related to the `tag.ts` file:

---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "apps/cli/src/commands/tag.ts" • **0** files</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

---

Let me check the import statements at the beginning of the tag.ts file:

---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "OpenAIClient.*TaggingService" • **2** files</summary>
        
| File | Line | Match |
|------|------|-------|
| `file:///Users/khallmark/Desktop/Code/obsidian-magic/apps/cli/src/commands/tag.ts` | L8 | `import { OpenAIClient, TaggingService, logger } from '@obsidian-magic/core';` |
| `file:///Users/khallmark/Desktop/Code/obsidian-magic/packages/core/src/integration.test.ts` | L7 | `import type { BatchProcessingService, DocumentProcessor, OpenAIClient, TaggingService, TaxonomyManager } from '.';` |

</details>

---

I see there's a typo in the import statement at line 7-8 in the tag.ts file. Let's fix that:

---

```diff
  import fs from 'fs-extra';
  
- import { OpenAIClient } from '@obsidian-magic/core/OpenAIClient';
- import { TaggingService } from '@obsidian-magic/core/TaggingService';
- import { Logger } from '@obsidian-magic/core/utils/Logger';
+ import { OpenAIClient, TaggingService, logger } from '@obsidian-magic/core';
  
  import { config } from '../utils/config';
```

---

I need to check the core package to see how these modules should be properly imported:

---

            <summary>Searched codebase "export OpenAIClient TaggingService logger" • **25** results</summary>

</details>

Now I understand the problem. Let me check the utility files that handle these imports correctly:

---

Read file: apps/cli/src/utils/core/openai.ts

---

Read file: apps/cli/src/utils/core/logger.ts

---

Now I understand the correct way to import these modules. Let's fix the imports in tag.ts:

---

```diff
  import fs from 'fs-extra';
  
- import { OpenAIClient } from '@obsidian-magic/core/OpenAIClient';
- import { TaggingService } from '@obsidian-magic/core/TaggingService';
- import { Logger } from '@obsidian-magic/core/utils/Logger';
+ import { OpenAIClient } from '@obsidian-magic/core/openai/OpenAIClient';
+ import { TaggingService } from '@obsidian-magic/core/openai/TaggingService';
+ import { logger } from '../utils/core/logger';
  
  import { config } from '../utils/config';
  
  import type { TagOptions } from '../types/commands';
- import type { logger } from '../utils/logger';
  
  const logger = Logger.getInstance()
```

---

I see we need to fix a few more issues. Let me check the logger implementation in the file:

---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "Logger.getInstance" • **8** files</summary>
        
| File | Line | Match |
|------|------|-------|

| `file:///Users/khallmark/Desktop/Code/obsidian-magic/apps/cli/src/commands/taxonomy.ts` | L9 | `const logger = Logger.getInstance();` |
| `file:///Users/khallmark/Desktop/Code/obsidian-magic/apps/cli/src/utils/logger.ts` | L8 | `export const logger = Logger.getInstance();` |

| `file:///Users/khallmark/Desktop/Code/obsidian-magic/apps/cli/src/utils/workflow.ts` | L4 | `const logger = Logger.getInstance('Workflow');` |
| `file:///Users/khallmark/Desktop/Code/obsidian-magic/apps/cli/src/utils/core/logger.ts` | L10 | `export const logger = Logger.getInstance();` |
| `file:///Users/khallmark/Desktop/Code/obsidian-magic/packages/core/src/utils/Logger.test.ts` | L5 | `const logger = Logger.getInstance();` |
| `file:///Users/khallmark/Desktop/Code/obsidian-magic/apps/cli/src/commands/tag.ts` | L20 | `const logger = Logger.getInstance()` |

</details>
