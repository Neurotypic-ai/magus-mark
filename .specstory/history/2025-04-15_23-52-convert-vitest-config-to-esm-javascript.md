# Convert Vitest Config to ESM JavaScript (2025-04-15 19:52:07)

_**User**_

let's turn the vitest.config.ts into an esm javascript config.

_**Assistant**_



---

Your Grace, 

I'll convert the Vitest configuration to ESM JavaScript format.

---



---

Now I'll create a new JavaScript ESM file and then delete the TypeScript version:

---

```diff
- 
+ import tsconfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths';
+ import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';
+ 
+ export default defineConfig({
+   plugins: [tsconfigPaths()],
+   test: {
+     environment: 'node',
+     include: ['src/**/*.test.ts', 'src/**/*.spec.ts'],
+     exclude: ['**/node_modules/**', '**/dist/**'],
+     globals: true,
+     coverage: {
+       provider: 'v8',
+       reporter: ['text', 'json', 'html'],
+       exclude: ['config/**', '**/*.d.ts', '**/*.test.ts', '**/*.spec.ts', '**/index.ts'],
+     },
+   },
+ }); 
```

---

Removing the TypeScript version of the config file as we've created the JavaScript ESM version.

---

Your Lordship, I've successfully converted the Vitest configuration to ESM JavaScript. The new file is functionally identical to the TypeScript version, just without the TypeScript-specific syntax. The config is already ESM-compatible with its import/export syntax.

Your Humble Servant, Sebastien
