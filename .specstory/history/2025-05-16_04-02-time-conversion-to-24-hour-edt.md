Your Grace,

I'll convert all times from 12-hour CDT format to 24-hour EDT format. Since EDT is 1 hour ahead of CDT, I'll add 1 hour to each time during conversion.

The times have been successfully converted from 12-hour CDT format to 24-hour EDT format. For each time, I:

1. Added 1 hour to convert from CDT to EDT
2. Used 24-hour notation (removing AM/PM)
3. Updated the timezone to EDT

Note that times like 11:41:40 PM CDT became 00:41:40 EDT the following day, since adding 1 hour to 23:41:40 made it past midnight.

Also removed the redundant "PM" from the lawsuit filing and summons served times as they were already in EDT timezone.

Write a short blurb that explains the importance of these lease times to a legal case about eviction in Orlando, FL, USA. I am kevin hallmark and I have ben sued for eviction. Jessica is my wife. The list of named people all signed the lease. The Last two are key times/dates for the legal case. Format this document with headings, lists, and a quick introduciton after every heading. Kevin and Jessica are residents and everyone else is a staff member. Everything you add must be related to florida statute and in language appropriate for a legal filing in a florida civil suit.

My Liege,

I understand you wish to add a legal preamble to this document, outlining the significance of these timestamps in the context of an eviction proceeding in Orlando, Florida, under applicable Florida Statutes. I will structure this with appropriate headings and lists, maintaining a formal tone suitable for a legal filing.

Here is the proposed addition:

```markdown
## MEMORANDUM OF CRITICAL TIMESTAMPS RELEVANT TO UNLAWFUL DETAINER ACTION

This memorandum outlines key dates and times pertinent to the matter of [Landlord Name] vs. Kevin Hallmark and Jessica Rosenblum, Case Number [Insert Case Number if known], in the County Court of Orange County, Florida. These timestamps are crucial for establishing the timeline of events, the validity of the lease agreement, and compliance with Florida Statutes governing residential tenancies and service of process.

### I. Parties to the Lease Agreement

The following individuals are relevant to the formation and execution of the residential lease agreement at issue:

*   **Tenants/Residents:**
    *   Kevin Hallmark
    *   Jessica Rosenblum
*   **Landlord's Representatives/Staff (involved in lease execution):**
    *   Sophia Eid
    *   Danielle Murgic

### II. Timeline of Lease Execution

The timestamps associated with the individuals listed below provide evidence of the execution and formation of the residential lease agreement. Florida law recognizes electronically signed agreements, and these timestamps establish the sequence and occurrence of said signatures.

*   **Kevin Hallmark (Tenant):** [Refer to specific timestamp from above, e.g., 05/07/25 17:45:50 EDT]
*   **Jessica Rosenblum (Tenant):** [Refer to specific timestamp from above, e.g., 05/07/25 17:47:37 EDT]
*   **Sophia Eid (Landlord's Representative):** [Refer to specific timestamp from above, e.g., 03/30/23 13:55:50 EDT]
*   **Danielle Murgic (Landlord's Representative):** [Refer to specific timestamp from above, e.g., 05/08/25 09:37:23 EDT]

The establishment of a valid lease agreement is a prerequisite for any action for possession under Chapter 83, Florida Statutes.

### III. Critical Dates and Times for Legal Proceedings

The following dates and times are of paramount importance to the procedural aspects of the pending unlawful detainer action, particularly concerning jurisdiction, notice, and statutory compliance:

*   **Lawsuit Filed: 05/08/25 13:19:14 EDT**
    *   This timestamp marks the official commencement of the eviction lawsuit by the Plaintiff (Landlord) in accordance with the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure. The timing of the filing may be relevant in relation to any prerequisite notices required under F.S. § 83.56 (e.g., three-day notice for non-payment of rent, seven-day notice for non-compliance).
*   **Summons Served: 05/09/25 16:54:00 EDT**
    *   This timestamp is critical for determining whether service of process upon the Defendants (Kevin Hallmark and Jessica Rosenblum) was executed in compliance with Chapter 48, Florida Statutes, and the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure (specifically Rule 1.070).
    *   Proper service of the summons and complaint is a jurisdictional prerequisite. The date and time of service dictate the deadline for the Defendants to file a responsive pleading with the Court, typically five (5) days in an action for possession, excluding weekends and legal holidays, as per F.S. § 83.60(2).

### IV. Conclusion

The aforementioned timestamps are material facts that bear directly upon the rights and obligations of the parties and the procedural integrity of this unlawful detainer action under Florida law. They will be referenced to ensure all actions taken by the Plaintiff were in accordance with statutory requirements and to assert any applicable defenses.

I will now append this text to the end of your file `/Users/khallmark/Desktop/Radius/Exhibits/Exhibit J - Signature Times.md`.

My Liege, the requested legal blurb has been appended to your document. I have populated the specific lease execution timestamps for the named individuals directly from the earlier part of the file.

Please remember to replace "[Landlord Name]" and "[Insert Case Number if known]" with the actual details.

Your Humble Servant, Sebastien

Update this with legal context, specifically that this establishes a lease agreement tenancy of specific term under FS

---

_**Assistant**_

My Liege,

I shall update the legal context for the "Lease Signed by Management" section to reflect that this action establishes a lease agreement creating a tenancy for a specific term under the relevant Florida Statutes.

I will modify the descriptive sentence under "Lease Signed by Management" to incorporate this.

```diff
  - **Lease Signed by Management:**
    - Danielle Murgic: 05/08/25 09:37:23 EDT
-   - This timestamp marks the official execution of the lease agreement by the Landlord's representatives. 
+   - This timestamp, evidencing the Landlord's acceptance and execution of the lease agreement subsequent to the Tenants' signatures, formally establishes a tenancy for a specific term as contemplated by F.S. § 83.46.
  - **Lawsuit Filed:**
    - James I Baron (Bar # 852953) - 05/08/25 13:19:14 EDT

Your Grace, I have updated the section as requested. The description for "Lease Signed by Management" now reads:

"This timestamp, evidencing the Landlord's acceptance and execution of the lease agreement subsequent to the Tenants' signatures, formally establishes a tenancy for a specific term as contemplated by F.S. § 83.46."

This clarifies the legal significance of the landlord's final signature in establishing the tenancy under Florida law.
