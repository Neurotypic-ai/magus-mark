Fix the @Linter errors

Your Lordship, I shall fix the linter errors in the CLI code immediately.

---

```diff
    try {
      costManager.saveUsageData();
-   } catch (e) {
+   } catch (_) {
      // Ignore errors during cleanup
    }
    } else if (reason instanceof Error) {
      logger.error(`Unhandled rejection: ${reason.message}`);
-     logger.debug(reason.stack || '');
+     logger.debug(reason.stack ?? '');
    } else {
      logger.error(`Unhandled rejection: ${String(reason)}`);
    try {
      costManager.saveUsageData();
-   } catch (e) {
+   } catch (_) {
      // Ignore errors during cleanup
    }
        .wrap(120)
        .fail((msg: string, err: Error) => {
-         if (err) {
-           // Handle custom errors
-           if (err instanceof AppError) {
-             logger.error(err.format());
-             if (err.recoverable) {
-               logger.info('Try running with --verbose for more details');
-             }
-           } else {
-             logger.error(msg || err.message);
-           }
-         } else {
-           logger.error(msg);
+         // Handle custom errors
+         if (err instanceof AppError) {
+           logger.error(err.format());
+           if (err.recoverable) {
+             logger.info('Try running with --verbose for more details');
+           }
+         } else {
+           logger.error(msg || err.message);
          }
          process.exit(1);
  
      // Save any usage data before exiting successfully
-     costManager.saveUsageData();
+     try {
+       costManager.saveUsageData();
+     } catch (_) {
+       // Ignore errors during cleanup
+     }
    } catch (error) {
      if (error instanceof AppError) {
      try {
        costManager.saveUsageData();
-     } catch (e) {
+     } catch (_) {
        // Ignore errors during cleanup
      }
  }
  
- main();
+ main().catch((error) => {
+   if (error instanceof AppError) {
+     logger.error(error.format());
+   } else {
+     logger.error(`Error: ${error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error)}`);
+     if (error instanceof Error && error.stack) {
+       logger.debug(error.stack);
+     }
+   }
+   process.exit(1);
+ });
  
```

Your Grace, we need to address the new linter errors. Let me fix those immediately:

---

```diff
    try {
      costManager.saveUsageData();
-   } catch (_) {
+   } catch {
      // Ignore errors during cleanup
    }
    try {
      costManager.saveUsageData();
-   } catch (_) {
+   } catch {
      // Ignore errors during cleanup
    }
      try {
        costManager.saveUsageData();
-     } catch (_) {
+     } catch {
        // Ignore errors during cleanup
      }
      try {
        costManager.saveUsageData();
-     } catch (_) {
+     } catch {
        // Ignore errors during cleanup
      }
  }
  
- main().catch((error) => {
+ main().catch((error: unknown) => {
    if (error instanceof AppError) {
      logger.error(error.format());
```

Your Lordship, all linter errors have been successfully resolved in the CLI code. The following changes were made:

1. Replaced unused catch variables with empty catch blocks for cleaner error handling
2. Changed `||` to `??` for nullish coalescing to safely handle potential null values
3. Removed the unnecessary conditional check in the error handler
4. Added proper promise rejection handling for the main function with correct typing

The code now properly follows TypeScript best practices and should pass all linter checks. Is there anything else you'd like me to improve in this file?

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'x' is of type 'unknown'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Your Grace, the error occurs because TypeScript infers `x` as type `unknown` in the callback after a failure, causing arithmetic operations to be invalid. Since this test is demonstrating short-circuit behavior, simply add a type annotation:

---

```diff
        const result = Result.ok(5)
          .andThen(() => Result.fail(error))
-         .andThen((x) => Result.ok(x + 1));
+         .andThen((x: number) => Result.ok(x + 1));
  
        expect(result.isFail()).toBe(true);
```

---

My Liege, we need a different approach. Let's use type assertion instead:

---

```diff
        const result = Result.ok(5)
          .andThen(() => Result.fail(error))
-         .andThen((x: number) => Result.ok(x + 1));
+         .andThen((x) => Result.ok((x as number) + 1));
  
        expect(result.isFail()).toBe(true);
```

---

Your Lordship, the type assertion fixed the immediate issue. The remaining errors are unrelated warnings about async functions with no await expressions, which are actually intentional in this test case since they're just simple test functions. We can leave those as they are since they don't affect functionality.

Using `as number` tells TypeScript to treat the unknown value as a number, allowing the addition operation. This is appropriate in tests where we're verifying short-circuit behavior and the code path would never execute in practice.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Async arrow function 'successFn' has no 'await' expression.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Your Grace, the linter warns about async functions not using await. Since these test functions merely need to return promises, replace them with direct Promise methods:
