# Copy Filesystem Directives for Testing (2025-05-14 22:49:34)

_**User**_

@mcp.json copy the @magus-mcp.json filesystem directives to the @mcp.json so that we can test it in isolation without @magus-mcp 

---

_**Assistant**_

Your Lordship, I'll update the mcp.json file to include the filesystem server configuration directly, allowing you to test it without using the magus-mcp binary.

---

Read file: .cursor/mcp.json

---

Read file: .magus-mcp/magus-mcp.json

---

```diff
    "mcpServers": {
      "filesystem": {
-       "command": "/Users/khallmark/Desktop/Code/neurotypic-ai/magus-mark/magus-mcp",
-       "args": ["start", "filesystem"]
+       "command": "sh",
+       "args": ["-c", "npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem . > mcp_filesystem_stdout.log 2> mcp_filesystem_stderr.log"]
      },
      "git": {
```

---

Your Grace, I've updated the .cursor/mcp.json file to use the direct shell command for the filesystem server, bypassing the magus-mcp binary. This configuration mirrors what's in your .magus-mcp/magus-mcp.json file.

The filesystem server will now be launched directly with:
```
sh -c "npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem . > mcp_filesystem_stdout.log 2> mcp_filesystem_stderr.log"
```

This allows you to test the filesystem server in isolation, with any output directed to the log files for debugging. The server will be executed by npx directly, using the current directory (.) as the workspace.

does @magus-mcp listen on port 9484 and proxy requests to the server it spawns?

---

_**Assistant**_

Your Lordship, after examining the code and configuration files, I can confirm that the magus-mcp tool does not listen on port 9484 or proxy requests to servers it spawns.

The magus-mcp tool appears to be a simple launcher for MCP servers. When it runs the `start` command for a specific server, it:

1. Loads the configuration for that server from magus-mcp.json
2. Prepares the appropriate command (npx, docker, bin, etc.)
3. Executes the command directly using syscall.Exec, which replaces the current process with the new command

This is evident in the start.go file, where each runner type implementation (startNpxServer, startDockerServer, etc.) ends with a call to syscall.Exec. This means magus-mcp doesn't stay running - it completely hands off execution to the actual server process.

Regarding port 9484 specifically:
- This port is mentioned only in your mcp.json file for the "nx-mcp" server with a URL "http://localhost:9484/sse"
- The nx-mcp service appears to be an external MCP server that's accessed directly via this URL
- It's not launched through magus-mcp but is instead accessed directly using the specified URL

The other servers launched by magus-mcp handle their own port binding without proxying. Where port configurations exist, they're passed directly to the spawned processes rather than being intercepted or proxied.

check @MCP and @MCP Servers and @Cursor Forums and try to find people who had this issue with wrapping mcp

---

_**Assistant**_

Your Lordship, I've examined the provided documentation about MCP servers and related issues. Here's what I've found regarding issues with wrapping MCP servers:

## Common Issues with Wrapping MCP Servers

1. **Timeout Errors:** In issue #267, a user experienced timeout errors when trying to implement various MCP servers including filesystem, memory, and playwright servers. The error message was:
   ```
   Could not attach to MCP server filesystem: eE: MCP error -2: Request timed out
   ```

2. **Process Termination:** In issue #1469, logs show that MCP servers start but terminate unexpectedly:
   ```
   Server transport closed unexpectedly, this is likely due to the process exiting early
   ```

3. **"Client Closed" Errors:** In issue #891, a user encountered "Client closed" errors when adding an MCP server in Cursor, even though running the same command manually in the terminal worked:
   ```
   stem: Client closed for command
   stem: Error in MCP: Client closed
   ```

4. **WSL Connection Issues:** In issue #86, users reported difficulties connecting to MCP servers running in WSL from Claude desktop.

## Root Causes & Solutions

The main issues with wrapping MCP servers appear to be:

1. **Process Replacement:** As we discovered in the magus-mcp code, using `syscall.Exec` replaces the current process with the new command. This means any wrappers don't stay running to proxy or manage the server.

2. **Configuration Issues:** Many problems stem from incorrect configuration, such as npm registry settings (issue #891).

3. **Environment Differences:** Commands that work in terminal may fail when launched through applications like Cursor due to different environment variables or working directories.

4. **Port Binding:** Some applications expect MCP to run on specific ports (like 3001 over SSE as mentioned in issue #521), but the documentation doesn't clearly explain port configuration.

## Recommendations

Based on these findings, when wrapping MCP servers:

1. Don't use process replacement methods like `syscall.Exec` if you need to maintain a wrapper process.
2. Consider using proper subprocess management to monitor and control the child process.
3. Ensure environment variables and working directories are correctly passed to the child process.
4. For Cursor specifically, the direct approach you're now using (changing .cursor/mcp.json to call npx directly) avoids many of these issues.

There's no clear evidence that the magus-mcp tool is designed to act as a proxy that listens on port 9484. Rather, it appears to be a launcher that hands off control entirely to the target MCP server process.

What must be done to turn it into a proper wrapper process that stays open and works correctly?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Your Lordship, to transform `magus-mcp` into a proper wrapper process that stays open and manages the MCP server it launches, we need to modify how it executes the server commands. Instead of using `syscall.Exec` (which replaces the `magus-mcp` process entirely), we should use the `os/exec` package to run the server as a child process and then wait for it to complete.

This involves the following conceptual changes:

1.  **Remove `syscall.Exec`:** The calls to `syscall.Exec` in functions like `startNpxServer`, `startDockerServer`, `startBinaryServer`, etc., within `tools/magus-mcp/cmd/start.go` need to be removed.
2.  **Use `cmd.Run()` or `cmd.Start()` + `cmd.Wait()`:**
    *   After preparing the `exec.Cmd` object (which is already being done), instead of `syscall.Exec`, you would call `cmd.Run()`. This function starts the specified command and waits for it to complete. `magus-mcp` would block until the child MCP server exits.
    *   Alternatively, you could use `cmd.Start()` followed by `cmd.Wait()`. `cmd.Start()` begins the command without waiting for it to complete. This allows `magus-mcp` to perform other actions if needed while the child process runs. `cmd.Wait()` would then be called to wait for the child process to exit.
3.  **Handle I/O:** You'll want to connect the child process's standard input, output, and error streams to `magus-mcp`'s streams or to log files. This is typically done by setting `cmd.Stdin`, `cmd.Stdout`, and `cmd.Stderr`. For example:
    ```go
    cmd.Stdin = os.Stdin
    cmd.Stdout = os.Stdout
    cmd.Stderr = os.Stderr
    ```
    This way, output from the MCP server will appear as if `magus-mcp` itself is producing it, or it can be captured and logged by `magus-mcp`.
4.  **Process Management & Timeout:**
    *   The existing timeout logic (which was noted as ineffective with `syscall.Exec` for some runners) can now be implemented more reliably. If `cmd.Start()` is used, `magus-mcp` can have a separate goroutine that sleeps for the timeout duration and then calls `cmd.Process.Kill()` if the child process is still running.
    *   `magus-mcp` can also capture the exit code of the child process and log it or take other actions.

Let's look at an example for one of the server types.

I will first read the `tools/magus-mcp/cmd/start.go` file to provide a concrete example.

---

Read file: tools/magus-mcp/cmd/start.go

---

My Liege, I have reviewed the `tools/magus-mcp/cmd/start.go` file. As anticipated, functions like `startNpxServer`, `startDockerServer`, `startUvxServer`, `startPipServer`, and `startBinaryServer` all use `syscall.Exec` at the end to launch the respective MCP servers.

To modify `magus-mcp` into a proper wrapper, we would alter these functions. Taking `startNpxServer` as an example, the end of the function currently looks like this:

```go
	// Replace current process using syscall.Exec
	internal.Verbose(fmt.Sprintf("Executing via syscall.Exec: %s %v", cmdPath, npxArgs))
	err = syscall.Exec(cmdPath, append([]string{cmdPath}, npxArgs...), cmd.Env)
	if err != nil {
		// This error only happens if Exec itself fails (e.g., permission denied), not if the command fails
		return fmt.Errorf("failed to execute npx command via syscall.Exec: %w", err)
	}
	// syscall.Exec does not return on success
	return nil // Should not be reached
}
```

We would change this section to:

```go
	// Connect child process's stdio to the parent's (magus-mcp)
	cmd.Stdin = os.Stdin
	cmd.Stdout = os.Stdout
	cmd.Stderr = os.Stderr

	internal.Log(fmt.Sprintf("Starting NPX server as a child process: %s %s", cmdPath, strings.Join(npxArgs, " ")))
	// Start the command and wait for it to complete.
	// magus-mcp will remain running until the npx server exits.
	err = cmd.Run() 
	if err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("npx server command failed: %w", err)
	}

	internal.Log(fmt.Sprintf("NPX server exited."))
	return nil
}
```

Key changes in this proposed modification:

1.  `syscall.Exec(...)` is replaced with `cmd.Run()`.
2.  `cmd.Stdin = os.Stdin`, `cmd.Stdout = os.Stdout`, `cmd.Stderr = os.Stderr` are added before `cmd.Run()` to ensure that the input/output of the child MCP server process is connected to `magus-mcp`'s input/output. This way, you'll see the server's logs directly and can interact with it if it expects stdin.
3.  The `magus-mcp` process will now wait for `cmd.Run()` to return, meaning it stays alive as long as the child `npx` process is running.
4.  Error handling is adjusted: `cmd.Run()` returns an error if the command starts and exits with a non-zero status, or if it couldn't be started.

This same pattern would be applied to `startDockerServer`, `startUvxServer`, `startPipServer`, and `startBinaryServer`.

For the `startDockerServer` function, the `prepareCommand` call is currently skipped because `syscall.Exec` was used directly. With this change, you would create the `cmd := exec.Command(cmdPath, dockerArgs...)` and then call `prepareCommand(cmd, cfg, timeoutSecs)` similar to how other server types do it, before setting stdio and calling `cmd.Run()`.

The timeout logic in `prepareCommand` would also become more relevant:
```go
	// Handle timeout if specified
	if timeoutSecs > 0 {
		go func() {
			time.Sleep(time.Duration(timeoutSecs) * time.Second)
			// Check if the process pointer and its Process field are valid before trying to signal
			if cmd != nil && cmd.Process != nil { // Check cmd itself first
				internal.Log(fmt.Sprintf("Server timed out after %d seconds, attempting to terminate %s (PID: %d)", timeoutSecs, cmd.Path, cmd.Process.Pid))
				// Attempt graceful termination first
				errSignal := cmd.Process.Signal(syscall.SIGTERM)
				if errSignal != nil {
					internal.Verbose(fmt.Sprintf("Failed to send SIGTERM: %v. Attempting SIGKILL.", errSignal))
					cmd.Process.Kill() // Force kill if SIGTERM fails or is not supported
				} else {
					// Give it a moment to shut down gracefully after SIGTERM
					time.Sleep(2 * time.Second) // Increased grace period
					// Check if it's still alive, then kill
					// This check is tricky as the process might have exited.
					// A common pattern is to try Kill regardless or use a channel with cmd.Wait()
					// For simplicity here, we'll assume SIGTERM might work or we proceed to kill
					// In a more robust setup, you'd use cmd.Wait in the main goroutine and a context for timeout.
					// However, given cmd.Run() is blocking, this goroutine is the primary way to interrupt.
					// If the process already exited, Kill() will likely error out, which is fine.
					cmd.Process.Kill() 
				}
			} else {
				internal.Verbose(fmt.Sprintf("Timeout goroutine: Command or process not started or already completed for %s.", cmd.Path))
			}
		}()
	}
```
This timeout logic now has a chance to kill the child process if `magus-mcp` (and thus `cmd.Run()`) is still blocked.

By making these changes, `magus-mcp start <server>` will launch the specified server as a true child process, and `magus-mcp` itself will remain running as its parent/wrapper until that child process terminates.

Would you like me to draft the specific code edits for `tools/magus-mcp/cmd/start.go` to implement this?

Your Lordship, I will now proceed to modify the `tools/magus-mcp/cmd/start.go` file to transform `magus-mcp` into a proper wrapper process. This involves changing how it launches the MCP servers, using `cmd.Run()` instead of `syscall.Exec`, and ensuring standard I/O streams are correctly piped.

This will make `magus-mcp` remain active as the parent process of the launched MCP server.

Your Grace, I have instructed my scribes to make the necessary modifications to `tools/magus-mcp/cmd/start.go`.

The key changes implemented are:
*   Replaced all instances of `syscall.Exec` with `cmd.Run()`.
*   Ensured that standard input, output, and error streams of the child MCP server processes are piped to `magus-mcp`'s streams. This means you'll see the server's logs directly in your console where `magus-mcp` is running.
*   Adjusted the `startDockerServer` function to correctly use `prepareCommand` before creating the `exec.Cmd` object, ensuring consistent behavior with other server types.
*   Improved error reporting to include the exit code and stderr if the child process fails.

With these alterations, when you execute `magus-mcp start <server-name>`, `magus-mcp` will now launch the specified server as a child process and remain running as its parent. It will wait for the child server process to terminate, effectively acting as a proper wrapper. The timeout logic within `prepareCommand` should also now function as intended for all server types.

Setup my pnpm postinstall so that it compiles magua-mcp then puts it in the projectRoot/bin/magus-mcp folder. Exclude the folder from git in my .gitignore. Adjust the code so that we are loolking for "magus-mcp.config.json" in the root of the project. 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

My Liege, I shall attend to these modifications immediately.

The plan is as follows:

1.  **Update Go Code for Configuration File Name:**
    *   Modify `tools/magus-mcp/internal/util.go` to change the default root configuration file name from `magus-mcp.json` to `magus-mcp.config.json`.
    *   Adjust `tools/magus-mcp/cmd/init.go` to ensure it uses this new default name when creating a root configuration file.
2.  **PNPM Postinstall Script:**
    *   Add a `postinstall` script to your root `package.json`. This script will:
        *   Ensure the `projectRoot/bin/` directory exists.
        *   Compile the `magus-mcp` Go application located in `tools/magus-mcp/`.
        *   Place the compiled binary into `projectRoot/bin/magus-mcp`.
3.  **Gitignore:**
    *   Add `/bin/` to your root `.gitignore` file to exclude the compiled binary and its directory from version control.

Let's begin by examining the current Go files to ensure the changes are applied correctly.

---

Read file: tools/magus-mcp/cmd/init.go

---

Read file: tools/magus-mcp/internal/util.go

---

Read file: package.json

---

Read file: .gitignore

---

My Liege, I have reviewed the files. The `init.go` script correctly uses `internal.DefaultRootConfigFile`, so updating the constant in `util.go` will suffice for that part. The `package.json` already has a `postinstall` script: `"postinstall": "node tools/scripts/build-magus-mcp.js"`. We should modify this existing script or replace its functionality. The `.gitignore` already has entries for `magus-mcp` binaries within the `tools/magus-mcp` directory, so we'll add a new entry for the root `bin` directory.

Here are the proposed changes:

**1. Update Go code for config file name:**
I will modify `tools/magus-mcp/internal/util.go` to change the `DefaultRootConfigFile` constant.

**2. Update PNPM Postinstall Script in `package.json`:**
I will modify the existing `postinstall` script to perform the compilation and placement of the `magus-mcp` binary. Instead of calling `node tools/scripts/build-magus-mcp.js`, it will now directly execute the necessary shell commands. I will also ensure the `bin` directory is created if it doesn't exist.

```diff
      "obsidian:build": "nx build obsidian",
      "obsidian:dev": "nx run obsidian:dev",
-     "postinstall": "node tools/scripts/build-magus-mcp.js",
+     "postinstall": "mkdir -p bin && cd tools/magus-mcp && go build -o ../../bin/magus-mcp . && cd ../..",
      "test": "nx run-many --target=test --all",
      "typecheck": "nx run-many --target=typecheck --all",
```

---

**3. Update `.gitignore`:**
I will add `/bin/` to your root `.gitignore` file.
