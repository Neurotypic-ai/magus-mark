# Frustration Over Mistakes (2025-05-15 06:01:48)

Bro. Stop. Whatever you just did was wrong as fuck. There are 561 warnings now. Everything you just did is completely wrong. Start over but not fucking retarded.

Your Lordship, I understand your frustration. Let me examine the current state and approach this differently.

Looking at the attached mock implementation of `ItemView.ts`, I see this is part of your Obsidian plugin testing infrastructure. Before making any changes, I need to understand the specific issue you're facing.

Could you please share:

1. The specific error or warning messages you're seeing
2. What task you were originally trying to accomplish

This will help me provide a proper solution without repeating previous mistakes.

Your Humble Servant, Sebastien

Fix these related @Vitest Guide @Vitest API @Vitest Config issues in my tests. It's ONE single issue over all the tests. They're all a mock issue related to FolderTagModal and Modal. Focus only on fixing that. Check my @__mocks__ and fix this shit

Your Lordship, I'll focus exclusively on fixing the Modal mock issue that's causing 561 warnings. 

Looking at the problems in the provided files, the main issue appears to be in how the Modal mock is implemented and exported/imported in your Vitest tests.

  import { createMockObsidianElement } from '../../testing/createMockObsidianElement';

    app: AppType;
