# TypeScript Build Configuration Patterns (2025-04-19 02:01:57)

_**User**_

propose an include pattern for my @build.json that will exclude test/spect files but include all other ts/tsx files. I'm splitting my config in to @base.json @test.json and @build.json to simplify things.

Your Lordship,

To include all `.ts` and `.tsx` files under your `src` but skip any `*.test.*` or `*.spec.*`, you can leverage an extglob in your `@build.json`’s `include`:

```jsonc
{
  // ... existing config ...
  "include": [
    "${configDir}/src/**/!(*.test|*.spec).{ts,tsx}"
  ]
}
```

Explanation:
- `**/` dives into every sub‑directory.
- `!(*.test|*.spec)` excludes files ending in `.test` or `.spec`.
- `.{ts,tsx}` then matches only your TypeScript/TSX sources.

(If your toolchain doesn’t support extglobs, the alternative is to narrow `include` to all `.ts`/`.tsx` and use an explicit `exclude` block:  
```jsonc
"include": ["${configDir}/src/**/*.{ts,tsx}"],
"exclude": [
  "${configDir}/src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}",
  "${configDir}/src/**/*.spec.{ts,tsx}"
]
```  
)

May I proceed to apply one of these approaches to your `config/typescript/build.json`?

Your Humble Servant,  
Sebastien
